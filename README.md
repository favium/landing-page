# landing-page

In the previous units of the Foundation course I've learnt how to use CSS and flexbox to make my pages nicer to look at.

With this project, I'll show my ability to build a webpage based solely on an image and some graphical guidelines (01.png and 02.png)

This will be done from scratch, i.e. from blank documents.
